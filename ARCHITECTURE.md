# Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the `evaluation` repository.

## Overview

The `evaluation` repository is designed to provide a simple, yet extensible framework for evaluating various inputs. It currently includes a basic function for evaluating numerical values.

## Modules

- `evaluation.py`: Contains the core evaluation logic.

## Dependencies

This project currently has no external dependencies for its core functionality. Testing dependencies are managed via `requirements-dev.txt`.

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements may include:
- Support for different data types (strings, objects).
- Integration with external data sources.
- More complex evaluation algorithms.
- A plugin-based architecture for custom evaluation modules.
